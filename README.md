# Implementing Cisco Secure Mobility Solutions (300-209)
 
## Exam Description
 
The Implementing Cisco Secure Mobility Solutions (SIMOS) (300-209) exam tests a network security engineer on the variety of Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions that Cisco has available on the Cisco ASA firewall and Cisco IOS software platforms. This 90-minute exam consists of 65–75 questions and assesses the knowledge necessary to properly implement highly secure remote communications through VPN technology, such as remote access SSL VPN and site-to-site VPN (DMVPN, FlexVPN). Candidates can prepare for this exam by taking the Implementing Cisco Secure Mobility Solutions (SIMOS) course.
